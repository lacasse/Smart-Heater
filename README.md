# Smart-Heater

Canadian winters are cold so I made a "smart" electric heater for my room to be nice and warm when I get out of bed in the morning.

I accomplished this using a Raspberry Pi 3, 433 MHz radio chips, a temperature sensor, and an Etekcity remote outlet.

I followed [this guide](https://zenofall.com/simple-home-automation-using-raspberry-pi-with-433mhz-radio-chips-etekcity-remote-outlet-and-python/) to get started using the radio chips and then modified the code to fit my needs.
